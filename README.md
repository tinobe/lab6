using the Euler forward and backward methods. Integrate from *t=0* up to *t=5 t_{hl}*, where *t_{hl}* is the time for which the analytic solution *y(t_{hl}) = 0.5*.

Plot both numerical solutions and the analytic solution in GNUplot. Vary your step-width *dt*
and the constant lambda. What are your observations?
